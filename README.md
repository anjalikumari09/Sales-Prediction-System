**=====Sales Analysis Prediction using Polynomial Regression=====**

This project focuses on building a Sales Prediction model using Polynomial Regression to analyze historical sales data and forecast future trends. The model captures non-linear relationships between independent variables (such as advertising spend, time, or other influencing factors) and sales performance to improve prediction accuracy.

**Objective**

Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and patterns
Model non-linear relationships using Polynomial Regression
Predict future sales with improved accuracy
Support data-driven business decision-making

**Tech Stack**

Python
NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Polynomial Regression modeling

**Workflow**

Data Collection & Loading
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering (Polynomial feature transformation)
Model Training using Polynomial Regression
Model Evaluation
Sales Forecast Prediction

**Model**

Implemented Polynomial Regression using sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures
Trained model using LinearRegression() on transformed polynomial features
Captures non-linear sales trends for better predictive performance

**Evaluation Metrics**

R² Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Outcome**

Successfully developed a regression model capable of predicting sales trends
Achieved improved accuracy compared to simple linear regression
Provided insights into how influencing factors impact sales performance
